I’d like a hyperlinked menu when you open the fatigue page. And
something similar, a drop-down menu on the hamburger menu as well.
I’d like each menu item linked to either text/pdf below (on the following
slides) or to online literature.
Are you okay with linking outside the app? Or do you want everything
published in the app?
Is it ok to have embedded pdfs? Or do you want script/text?
The outside links are all to fdx.alpa.org pages. (log in required)
On the present app you have one continuous page that you scroll up. I
am not sure of the architecture that is easiest... But I need it all to start
with a menu that links to what the pilot needs.

IM SAFE Checklist
Are you fit for duty?
Illness: Are you suffering from any illness or symptoms that might
affect you or other crewmembers? Cold? Congested?
Medication: Are you taking prescriptions? Over-the-counter? How long should you wait
before you are legal to go flying. ex: Benadryl - 60 hours before you can fly.
Stress: Three types: Physiological, Environmental, and Psychological. What life factors
are occupying your thoughts? Family? Financial? Too hot? Too cold? Commuting?
Alcohol: Legal limits aren’t always clear cut for your performance. Some countries have
zero tolerance. FAA recommends pilots wait at least 24 hours after drinking to get
behind the controls.
Fatigue: Look-back (When did you last sleep? Quality? Last 24 hours?) and look
forward: How long is your duty period? Do you have a proper sleep strategy?
Emotion/Eating: How do you feel? Hangry? Properly hydrated?
Any of the above issues will affect your ability to perform. If your assessment is below
par - do not go flying. Remember, self-assessment isn’t always accurate. Talk this over
with your crewmember(s), family member, friend or the Duty Officer.

CARMA Checklist
When calling out fatigued in the field your priority is rest. Regardless of when and
where you call out fatigued, the Company shall provide:
1.Ground Transportation (GT)
2.Hotel accommodations
3.Deadhead back to base (processing should occur during your rest period, and a
minimum of 8 hours after you get to the hotel.)
Note: Duty Officer will create An Accepted Fare Letter that will cover the deadhead
expense back to base. The funds are not usable outside this deadhead and the reverse is
true—other deviation bank funds are not usable for the deadhead immediately following a
fatigue call.
The CARMA Checklist was created to give pilots guidance when calling fatigued and the
trip is/was terminated.
There are five basic fatigue call scenarios:
1.Before check-in with legal rest
2.Before check-in without legal rest (ex: hub turn)
3.After check-in and trip postponed
4.After check-in and trip revised
5.After check-in and removed from the balance of the trip
The CARMA Checklist was created for number five above when you need to make a
fatigue call after trip check-in and the Company “removes” you from the balance of the trip
(12.A.9.b.iii.; 12.C.5.b.ii.(c); 12.D.6.c.ii.(c))

CARMA Checklist (cont.)
The reason for the CARMA Checklist is the pilot could be left on their own by the
Company after a fatigue call due to CRS working to re-crew the flight that is now
uncovered as a result of the fatigue call..
Accountability: The Company has an ethical and professional responsibility to know
where the pilot is and how long they are on duty at all times until the pilot has returned to
their base or deviated from the new back-end deadhead.
CARMA Checklist
The CARMA Checklist is only for when the Company removes you from the balance of
your trip following a fatigue call after trip check-in.
•If you are “revised” (Do not use the CARMA Checklist): the Company will put you into
rest and the trip will continue.
•If you are “postponed,” (Do not use the CARMA Checklist): the Company will put
you into rest and the trip will continue.
•If you are “removed” from the balance of your trip (Use the CARMA Checklist): the
Company (should) put you into rest.

CARMA Checklist (cont.)
1.CALL OUT FATIGUED (paraphrasing CBA 12.A.9). A pilot who becomes excessively tired (fatigued) shall
notify CRS immediately and speak with the Duty Officer about their situation. If this happens during a trip and
the decision is made to remove you from the balance of the trip, the trip will “end” in that city (Note: fatigue at
base, during a hub turn (no legal rest between trips is also treated the same way.)
2.ARRANGE FOR REST. Work with the DO and Flight Services Desk (FSD) to arrange Ground Transportation and
hotel for recovery.
3.REST. DO NOT make travel arrangements until you are RESTED and RECOVERED.
4.MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB. If in the field, after rest, work with DO, CRS, GT and Flight Services to
deadhead back to base. After the required changes, only then can the crewmember deviate and make personal
arrangements (Pairing will only display activity up to fatigue call, nothing after.).
5.AFTER ACTION FATIGUE REPORT. The Company email sent to you will have a direct link. Secondary access is
available via the PFC Report link, where you will find your uncompleted report generated by the Duty Officer.
CALL out fatigued
ARRANGE for rest - GT and hotel**
REST/RECOVER
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB
AFTER ACTION - Fatigue Report - both Company and DART
** If CRS does not provide the GT and Hotel, immediately call the Duty Officer**.

CARMA Checklist (cont.)
Techniques/Notes:
1.Be Polite and Professional.
2.If you have legal rest, or a period of rest before operating, and feel the
next duty period warrants a fatigue call - contact CRS. Explain your concerns
about the pairing change or revision. If they do not amend the pairing to meet your
concerns tell CRS you understand and will do your best. Do not argue or engage.
You are now required to attempt rest. A recent example: pilots were revised to
catch a 0300 operational jumpseat and then operate to MEM. They called CRS and
said this was a challenging flip of their schedule, it would be hard to get immediate
rest and then operate during the critical period. CRS looked at their pairing and was
able to revise the pairing and keep them on their current circadian clock. No fatigue
call.
3.If fatigued prior to show, or you will be fatigued during your next duty period - call
the Duty Officer.
4.When calling out fatigued with the Duty Officer it is a fatigue call only, not a
discussion about the FOM or CBA. You are calling to say you are fatigued. The
pilot’s “script” is easy. Again, be polite and professional (which can be hard when
you are fatigued).

5. The Duty Officer has a “script” too…but only when you are calling out fatigued.
They need information to help with the reporting of the issue and then they follow
the CARMA Checklist above.
6. Reports: You do not have to call out fatigued to file a fatigue report. You can
submit a fatigue report anytime. Help us identify fatigue hazards – anything that
reduces your rest and increases your workload.

Trip Removal and Compensation
Trip Removal due to Fatigue (12.A.9)
1. A pilot who is excessively tired prior to actual check-in for a trip in base,
following a legal rest period... pilot will be removed from his trip and to the
extent he had trip guarantee, the hours shall be eligible for make-up (GMU
bank). (12.A.9.a). [Ex: B-Reserve, notified at 1300L, assigned a trip that
launches at 0030 and released in to rest]
2. A pilot who is excessively tired prior to actual check-in for a trip in base,
without a legal rest period... pilot will be removed from his trip, and that
trip will be placed into Sick Leave status, as provided in Section 14.B.5.
[Ex: Hub turning, call in fatigued for next trip]
3. A pilot who becomes excessively tired subsequent to actual trip checkin shall notify CRS immediately and talk to the Duty Officer about (their)
situation. Depending on the pilot’s situation and the DO’s assessment,
one of the following alternatives shall be enlisted to address the issue:
a. The pilot may be given a legal rest period, schedule will be revised to
continue. b. Pilot’s current trip may be revised to include some alternative
duty assignment. c. Pilot’s trip concludes, put in sick for remainder of trip.

Trip Removal and Compensation (cont.)
Compensation due to Fatigue After Trip Check-in (12.A.9.g)
The Fatigue Event Review Committee (FERC)* meets and discusses all
pilot fatigue calls made subsequent to actual trip check-in, with sick bank
deduction. The FERC will evaluate the circumstances surrounding the
fatigue call and will attempt to reach a consensus concerning
compensation for the trip (sick-bank reimbursement). We are at roughly
95% sick-bank reimbursement and 100% pay coverage.
Example 1 (No Reimbursement): Pilot calls in fatigued for hub turn trip
after inbound flight is delayed 1-hour due to maintenance. The pilot
mentions in his fatigue report narrative that he had difficulty sleeping due
to a head cold he’s been fighting for a couple of days. FERC decides: No
Reimbursement of Sick Bank.
Example 2 (Reimbursement): Pilot was scheduled for a single leg (XXXIND) duty period, had some difficulty resting in XXX but knew he only had
the one leg that night. Upon arrival into IND, he was advised that the trip
had been revised to operate an additional leg (IND-XXX) in the same duty
period. Knowing that he had difficulty resting in XXX and would not have
an opportunity to nap in IND prior to the additional leg, he felt unsafe to
continue and called in fatigue. FERC decides: Reimbursement of Sick
Bank.

Trip Removal and Compensation (cont.)
There are some cases where the sick bank is not charged at all. For
example, if a pilot is into overage (already operating beyond the original
end time of the trip) and calls in fatigue, the sick bank is not charged for
the remainder of that trip. The pilot will stop earning overage at the time of
the fatigue call.
*FERC: Consists of 2 FedEx Company employees and 2 ALPA members.

Fatigue Reporting
You do not need to call-in fatigued to file a fatigue report.
- File a Company Insite for operational issues: sleep rooms, recliners, …
- File a Company FEM (under Reports on PFC) to identify fatigue hazards
- Copy everything to a DART and reference Company report or ASAP
Company reports create Awareness and Data
DART reports create Accountability and Dialogue.
