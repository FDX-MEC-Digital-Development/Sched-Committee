# PRD: Calling in Fatigued Page Restructure

## **Overview**
Restructure the "Calling in Fatigued" page to improve information flow, reduce confusion, and provide clearer guidance for pilots calling in fatigued.

## **Background**

I'm doing work for a client on a web page. He's asking for a section called "Calling in Fatigued". I think the flow of it is confusing. Can I get your opinion? Here is what he is asking for:

CARMA Checklist​

When calling out fatigued in the field your priority is rest. Regardless of when and where you call out fatigued, the Company shall provide: ​

Ground Transportation (GT)​

Hotel accommodations​

Deadhead back to base (processing should occur during your rest period, and a minimum of 8 hours after you get to the hotel.) ​

Note: Duty Officer will create An Accepted Fare Letter that will cover the deadhead expense back to base. The funds are not usable outside this deadhead and the reverse is true—other deviation bank funds are not usable for the deadhead immediately following a fatigue call.​

The CARMA Checklist was created to give pilots guidance when calling fatigued and the trip is/was terminated.​

There are five basic fatigue call scenarios:​

Before check-in with legal rest​

Before check-in without legal rest (ex: hub turn)​

After check-in and trip postponed​

After check-in and trip revised​

After check-in and removed from the balance of the trip​

The CARMA Checklist was created for number five above when you need to make a fatigue call after trip check-in and the Company “removes” you from the balance of the trip (12.A.9.b.iii.; 12.C.5.b.ii.(c); 12.D.6.c.ii.(c))​

​

CARMA Checklist (cont.)​

The reason for the CARMA Checklist is the pilot could be left on their own by the Company after a fatigue call due to CRS working to re-crew the flight that is now uncovered as a result of the fatigue call.. ​

Accountability: The Company has an ethical and professional responsibility to know where the pilot is and how long they are on duty at all times until the pilot has returned to their base or deviated from the new back-end deadhead.​

CARMA Checklist​

The CARMA Checklist is only for when the Company removes you from the balance of your trip following a fatigue call after trip check-in. ​

If you are “revised” (Do not use the CARMA Checklist): the Company will put you into rest and the trip will continue. ​

If you are “postponed,” (Do not use the CARMA Checklist): the Company will put you into rest and the trip will continue. ​

If you are “removed” from the balance of your trip (Use the CARMA Checklist): the Company (should) put you into rest.​

​

​CARMA Checklist (cont.)​

CALL OUT FATIGUED (paraphrasing CBA 12.A.9). A pilot who becomes excessively tired (fatigued) shall notify CRS immediately and speak with the Duty Officer about their situation. If this happens during a trip and the decision is made to remove you from the balance of the trip, the trip will “end” in that city (Note: fatigue at base, during a hub turn (no legal rest between trips is also treated the same way.)​

ARRANGE FOR REST. Work with the DO and Flight Services Desk (FSD) to arrange Ground Transportation and hotel for recovery.​

REST. DO NOT make travel arrangements until you are RESTED and RECOVERED.​

MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB. If in the field, after rest, work with DO, CRS, GT and Flight Services to deadhead back to base. After the required changes, only then can the crewmember deviate and make personal arrangements (Pairing will only display activity up to fatigue call, nothing after.).​

AFTER ACTION FATIGUE REPORT. The Company email sent to you will have a direct link. Secondary access is available via the PFC Report link, where you will find your uncompleted report generated by the Duty Officer.​

​

CALL out fatigued​

ARRANGE for rest - GT and hotel** ​

REST/RECOVER​

MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB ​

AFTER ACTION - Fatigue Report - both Company and DART​

​

** If CRS does not provide the GT and Hotel, immediately call the Duty Officer**.​

CARMA Checklist (cont.)​

Techniques/Notes:​

Be Polite and Professional. ​

If you have legal rest, or a period of rest before operating, and feel the next duty period warrants a fatigue call - contact CRS. Explain your concerns about the pairing change or revision. If they do not amend the pairing to meet your concerns tell CRS you understand and will do your best. Do not argue or engage. You are now required to attempt rest. A recent example: pilots were revised to catch a 0300 operational jumpseat and then operate to MEM. They called CRS and said this was a challenging flip of their schedule, it would be hard to get immediate rest and then operate during the critical period. CRS looked at their pairing and was able to revise the pairing and keep them on their current circadian clock. No fatigue call.​

If fatigued prior to show, or you will be fatigued during your next duty period - call the Duty Officer.​

When calling out fatigued with the Duty Officer it is a fatigue call only, not a discussion about the FOM or CBA. You are calling to say you are fatigued. The pilot’s “script” is easy. Again, be polite and professional (which can be hard when you are fatigued). ​

​

CARMA Checklist (cont.)​

Techniques/Notes (cont.):​

5. The Duty Officer has a “script” too…but only when you are calling out fatigued. They need information to help with the reporting of the issue and then they follow the CARMA Checklist above.​

6. Reports: You do not have to call out fatigued to file a fatigue report. You can submit a fatigue report anytime. Help us identify fatigue hazards – anything that reduces your rest and increases your workload.​

Looking at this "Calling in Fatigued" section, I can see why the flow feels confusing. Here are the main issues I notice:

Structure Problems
Repetitive and scattered information: The CARMA acronym is explained multiple times in different places, and key concepts are repeated without clear organization.

Unclear hierarchy: The document jumps between high-level concepts and specific details without a logical progression. For example, the five fatigue scenarios are introduced early but then only scenario #5 is actually addressed.

Confusing title vs. content: The section is called "Calling in Fatigued" but spends most of its time explaining when NOT to use the CARMA checklist.

Content Flow Issues
Backwards explanation: The document explains what CARMA stands for, then explains when not to use it, then finally explains when to use it. This creates cognitive load.

Buried key information: Critical details like "only use CARMA when removed from trip after check-in" appear multiple times but aren't clearly emphasized upfront.

Techniques section placement: The practical tips at the end should probably come earlier or be integrated throughout.

Suggested Improvements
Start with the basics: Lead with a clear definition of when pilots should call in fatigued
Simplify the decision tree: Create a clear flowchart showing the five scenarios and which require CARMA
Front-load the acronym: Explain CARMA clearly once, early on
Separate procedures from tips: Put the step-by-step process first, then add techniques/notes
Use consistent formatting: The current mix of bullet points, numbered lists, and paragraphs makes it hard to scan
The core information is valuable, but it needs restructuring to be more user-friendly for fatigued pilots who need quick, clear guidance.


I think he will want to keep all of the content, but I'd like to just re-flow is and present it to him as an alternative, while explaining some of the ideas you brought up. Can you create this alternative version for me?

Calling in Fatigued - Alternative Structure
When to Call in Fatigued
A pilot who becomes excessively tired (fatigued) shall notify CRS immediately and speak with the Duty Officer about their situation. Be polite and professional - you are calling to report fatigue, not to discuss the FOM or CBA.

Before You Call
If you have legal rest before operating but have concerns about an upcoming duty period, first contact CRS to explain your concerns about pairing changes or revisions
If they cannot amend the pairing to address your concerns, accept professionally and attempt rest
Only call the Duty Officer if you are fatigued prior to show or will be fatigued during your next duty period
Five Fatigue Call Scenarios
Before check-in with legal rest
Before check-in without legal rest (ex: hub turn)
After check-in and trip postponed
After check-in and trip revised
After check-in and removed from the balance of the trip
The CARMA Checklist applies ONLY to scenario #5 - when the Company removes you from the balance of your trip following a fatigue call after trip check-in.

When NOT to Use CARMA Checklist:
"Revised": Company puts you into rest and the trip continues
"Postponed": Company puts you into rest and the trip continues
When to Use CARMA Checklist:
"Removed": Company removes you from the balance of your trip
CARMA Checklist Process
C - CALL out fatigued
A - ARRANGE for rest (GT and hotel)
R - REST/RECOVER
M - MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB
A - AFTER ACTION - Fatigue Report

Step-by-Step Details:
CALL OUT FATIGUED: Notify CRS immediately and speak with the Duty Officer. If during a trip and you're removed from the balance, the trip will "end" in that city.

ARRANGE FOR REST: Work with the DO and Flight Services Desk (FSD) to arrange Ground Transportation and hotel for recovery. If CRS does not provide GT and Hotel, immediately call the Duty Officer.

REST: DO NOT make travel arrangements until you are RESTED and RECOVERED. Your priority is rest.

MAKE ARRANGEMENTS for RTB: After rest, work with DO, CRS, GT and Flight Services to deadhead back to base. Processing should occur during your rest period, with a minimum of 8 hours after you get to the hotel. Only after required changes can you deviate and make personal arrangements.

AFTER ACTION FATIGUE REPORT: Complete the fatigue report using the direct link in the Company email or via the PFC Report link for uncompleted reports generated by the Duty Officer.

Company Responsibilities
Regardless of when and where you call out fatigued, the Company shall provide:

Ground Transportation (GT)
Hotel accommodations
Deadhead back to base
Accountability: The Company has an ethical and professional responsibility to know where the pilot is and how long they are on duty at all times until the pilot has returned to their base or deviated from the new back-end deadhead.

Important Notes:
Duty Officer will create an Accepted Fare Letter covering deadhead expenses back to base
These funds are only usable for this specific deadhead - other deviation bank funds cannot be used for fatigue-related deadheads
The CARMA Checklist exists because pilots could be left on their own after a fatigue call while CRS works to re-crew the uncovered flight
Additional Guidance
Reporting: You do not have to call out fatigued to file a fatigue report. Submit fatigue reports anytime to help identify fatigue hazards - anything that reduces rest and increases workload.

Remember: Both you and the Duty Officer follow scripts during fatigue calls. The DO needs information for reporting and will follow the CARMA process above.

Pairing Display: Your pairing will only show activity up to the fatigue call, nothing after.

Key Changes Made:
Front-loaded the decision tree so pilots immediately know when CARMA applies
Grouped company responsibilities separately for clarity
Made the step-by-step process the central focus
Moved techniques into context where they're most relevant
Eliminated repetition while preserving all original content
Used consistent formatting for better readability
This structure helps fatigued pilots quickly find the information they need without having to parse through explanations of when the checklist doesn't apply.

## **Current State**
- Simple accordion structure with 5 steps (CARMA)
- Limited context about when to use the process
- Missing critical decision-making information
- No explanation of different fatigue scenarios

## **Proposed Changes**

### **1. Update Page Header**
```

### **2. Add New Sections**

#### **Section 1: When to Call in Fatigued**

#### **Section 2: Five Fatigue Call Scenarios**


#### **Section 3: CARMA Checklist Process (already exists in FatigueCarmaChecklist.vue)**


### **4. Add Company Accountability Section**


## **Implementation Notes**

1. **Maintain existing phone number prominence** in the header area
2. **Use progressive disclosure** - key information first, details in accordions
3. **Add visual indicators** (colors, icons) to distinguish between scenarios
4. **Preserve all original content** while improving organization
5. **Make the decision tree prominent** so pilots quickly understand when CARMA applies
6. **The existing FatigueCarmaChecklist.vue** is excellent - it just needs to be added in the appropriate place in the new structure
6. **Carma.vue** is a poor name for the route and the page; consider renaming to something more descriptive like "CallingInFatigued.vue" or "FatigueManagement.vue"

## **Success Metrics**
- Reduced confusion about when to use CARMA checklist
- Faster access to critical information for fatigued pilots
- Clearer understanding of company responsibilities
- Better user flow from decision-making to action steps
