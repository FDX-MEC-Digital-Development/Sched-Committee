## Attribution

Attribution will be included in the footer or appropriate section of the mobile app.

## App Store Disclaimer:

The mobile app may be rejected from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. App store approval is subject to the policies and guidelines of Apple and Google, and any decisions made by these platforms are beyond the control of Joshua Carter.

## Open-Source Licensing:

The mobile app developed as part of this project will be released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3. The GPL license terms will apply to the distribution, modification, and use of the app's source code.

## Project Completion

While I am committed to delivering the mobile app according to the agreed-upon scope and timeline, I acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances may arise that could impact the project's completion. It is essential to establish that there are no punitive consequences if, for any reason, the project is not completed within the specified timeframe. I prioritize open communication and flexibility to address challenges that may arise during the project.
